# Medicare Calculator App

#### The app aims to help therapists accurately track and calculate billable units for Medicare patients' treatment sessions, ensuring compliance with the 8-minute rule set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The 8-minute rule requires therapists to document and bill in increments of 8 minutes for rehabilitation services provided to Medicare patients.

#### The calculator app would allow therapists to input the total duration of a treatment session and automatically calculate the appropriate billable units based on the 8-minute rule. This would help prevent potential fraud or abuse of services by accurately reflecting the time spent on each intervention, ensuring proper reimbursement from Medicare.

## Rules

1 - If CMS and service-based, then set unit to 1
2 - If AMA and service-based, then set unit to 0
